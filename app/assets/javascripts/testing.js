//so some basic js is created here.. what can i do with it..? It's precompiled.. but I also need it to use ruby data..
//maybe make the js accept ruby params that are passed in to it?

//this gets the element by id demo and changes the text in that demo... incredible. Make sure to use the innerhtml method..
function changeText() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
